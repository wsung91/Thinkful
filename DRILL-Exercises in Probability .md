### Randomness: Sampling and Selection Bias
- Variabiility and size sample required are directly related to each other
- https://courses.thinkful.com/data-201-prepv1/assignment/3.2.2
- ***selection bias*** systematic differences between the sample and the population
- Literary Digest poll
- Bayesian (relationship between subsequent events) vs. frequentist
``` P(red | blue) = 5/9 ```
- Conditional vs. Independent variables 

#### Qustion 1:
Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.

Independent variables, all the same, 
``` (1/2) ** 4 = 1/16 ``` 

#### Question 2:
not choosing a man:
``` 1 - 21/45 = 24/45 = 8/15 ```


#### Question 3:
(10%) * (.005%) = 0.05%

#### Question 4:
- Each click --> 5% short survey
- 15 min 
The sample is only considering a fraction of 5% of users that are using the website and is only taking those people that are willing to answer the survey into account.
